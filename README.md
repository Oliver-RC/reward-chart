# My Reward Chart

My Reward Chart is an interactive 'reward star chart' website. Primarily to be used by the parent / carer on a weekly basis to track the number of stars their child has earned for good behaviour. In return for earning stars, the child can choose a reward at the end of the week based on the number of stars achieved. Also, within the website is an interactive 'rock, paper, scissors' game for the child to interact with.

The sites simple look and feel, ease of navigation and interactive content will enable both the parent / carer and child to use together and/or independently. A core aim is to bring a sense of inclusion for the child; to lead what tasks they want to and what reward they want to pick, alongside an fun, interactive game.

## User Experience (UX)

 ### User Stories

  #### First Time Visitor Goals
   1. As a first time visitor I want to understand what the site is about and who the site is intended for. Starting with the title and core content of the page, these elements should give a clear idea.
   2. As a first time visitor the home / index page should be the starting point of the site and include the main interaction for the user.
   3. As a first time visitor the flow of each page should read top to bottom with the interactive content following suit. The home / index page should then allow the user to flow onto the next relevant page.
   4. As a first time visitor I want the content to be in a consistant and simple structure. Navigation bar at the top, main body of the page and footer at the bottom.
   5. As a first time visitor the interactive content should be intuitive and not require content heavy text to explain how to use.
  #### Returning Visitor Goals
   1. As a returning visitor I want to be able to update the interactive reward table with either a new task or star achieved.
   2. As a returning visitor I want to see the site and its content in the same state as it was previously left in order to track reward progress throughout the week.
   3. As a returning visitor I want to be able to interact with the built in 'rock, paper, scissors' game.
   4. As a returning visitor I want to be able to locate the social media links in order to gain further insight and information but delivered through the different platforms: Youtube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
  #### Frequent User Goals
   1. As a frequent user once a full week has been completed, I want to be able to reset the page in order to start a new week.
   2. As a frequent user I want the site to be my main 'reward' system for my child. I want the child to eventually become independant in using the site and be the lead in uploading tasks.
   3. As a frequent user I want to be able to provide user feedback to the owner of the site.
