# My Reward Chart

My Reward Chart is an interactive 'reward star chart' website. Primarily to be used by the parent / carer on a weekly basis to track the number of stars their child has earned for good behaviour. In return for earning stars, the child can choose a reward at the end of the week based on the number of stars achieved. Also, within the website is an interactive 'rock, paper, scissors' game for the child to interact with.

The sites simple look and feel, ease of navigation and interactive content will enable both the parent / carer and child to use together and/or independently. A core aim is to bring a sense of inclusion for the child; to lead what tasks they want to and what reward they want to pick, alongside an fun, interactive game.

## User Experience (UX)

 ### User Stories

  #### First Time Visitor Goals
   1. As a first time visitor I want to understand what the site is about and who the site is intended for. Starting with the title and core content of the page, these elements should give a clear idea.
   2. As a first time visitor the home / index page should be the starting point of the site and include the main interaction for the user.
   3. As a first time visitor the flow of each page should read top to bottom with the interactive content following suit. The home / index page should then allow the user to flow onto the next relevant page.
   4. As a first time visitor I want the content to be in a consistant and simple structure. Navigation bar at the top, main body of the page and footer at the bottom.
   5. As a first time visitor the interactive content should be intuitive and not require content heavy text to explain how to use.
  #### Returning Visitor Goals
   1. As a returning visitor I want to be able to update the interactive reward table with either a new task or star achieved.
   2. As a returning visitor I want to see the site and its content in the same state as it was previously left in order to track reward progress throughout the week.
   3. As a returning visitor I want to be able to interact with the built in 'rock, paper, scissors' game.
   4. As a returning visitor I want to be able to locate the social media links in order to gain further insight and information but delivered through the different platforms: Youtube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
  #### Frequent User Goals
   1. As a frequent user once a full week has been completed, I want to be able to reset the page in order to start a new week.
   2. As a frequent user I want the site to be my main 'reward' system for my child. I want the child to eventually become independant in using the site and be the lead in uploading tasks.
   3. As a frequent user I want to be able to provide user feedback to the owner of the site.

## Design

 ### Structure
  - The site will be made up of an initial home page, a game page, a reward page and a feedback form page.
  - Every page will be in a consistant layout aiding simple usability. 
    1. Navigation bar at the top with page title to the left and page links to the right.
    2. Core content of the page.
    3. Social media footer at the bottom.
    4. Consistant colour scheme throughout each page specifically on the header / nav bar, page link buttons and footer.
 ### Colour Scheme
 - Colour scheme of the site designed using: https://coolors.co/
 - The header, nav bar and footer make up the leading colours of the site, that being Mantis, a subtle, light off green, with green being a positive colour related to children and learning.
 - The font colour both in the headings and the body of the site is black as it is clear and consistant. 
 - Each section of the site has a distinct background colour with a supported border, this is consistant on each page. The same goes for each clickable button alongside hover effects when able to click and generate an action.
 ![Site Colour Scheme](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/my-reward-chart-colour-scheme.png)
 ### Typography
 - The [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree+serif) font is used for the headings throughout the site with Serif as the fallback. A relevant style for charts which is both professional and eye to read.
 - The [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) font is used for the content of the site with Sans-Serif as the fallback. Open Sans works well against the headings giving the font clear lines to read, adult and child friendly.
 ### Imagery
 - Images were only used on the reward page to provide a visual representation of the rewards available. They give the child a clear understanding of the type of reward. They should also be inspirational enough for the child to be motivated to achieve stars for good behaviour.
 - Icons feature heavily across the site with the 'star' icon being the hero in both the title and reward chart table. The 'star' features in the tally count and reward page giving the user visual reminders as to what the stars are for. Within the 'rock, paper, scissors' game, hand icons were used providing a consistant look and feel.

## Current Features

 ### Navigation Bar
 - A responsive navigation bar featured on all four pages with links to the main home page - the star chart, the star boost game page, my reward page and feedback form page, these are positioned to the right of the screen and will be responsive on small screens dropping to a hamburger menu. On the left is the website title that is clickable and takes the user back to the homepage. The navigation bar is identical on each page to provide a consistent look and ease of navigation.
 - This section allows the user to easily navigate from page to page without having to use the back button or relooping back to the homepage.

 ![Nav Bar](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/nav-bar.JPG)
 ### My Task Input
 -  The first interactive part of the site which the parent / carer is to use with their child in order to set the task for the week ahead.
 - An input field where the user types the title of the task and by either pressing enter or clicking the add button will add the task to the reward table below.

 ![My Task Input](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/task-input.JPG)
 ### My Reward Chart Stars
 -  This section of the site will count the numbers of stars achieved for the current week. The user will be able to monitor the progress as the week goes by. It is also a motivation tool for the child to keep up with good behaviour.

 ![My Reward Chart Stars](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/reward-chart-stars.JPG)
 ### Reward Chart
 - The tasks once added from the 'my task' section will remain in the table indefinitely until the 'end of the week' reset button is clicked.
 - Everytime the child succeeds in the task for that day, the user is able to click on the faded star in the table to bring it to life.
 - The table is responsive, on smaller screens there is no horizontal scroll, the table reverts to a new style that is mobile friendly.

 ![Reward Chart](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/reward-chart.JPG)
 ### Weekly Reset & Following Page Buttons
 - When a new week is about to start, the user is able to click the reset button and it will clear the data from the reward table above.
 - Below the reset button there are links to the subsequent pages that follow the order of completing the reward chart. Both a star game and reward page links. 
 - The background colour of the buttons are also used on their relevant pages in order to provide a visual reminder to the user as to which page they navigated to.

 ![Weekly Reset & Following Page Buttons](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/reset-page-buttons.JPG)
 ### The Footer
 - The footer section houses icons of the relevant social media platforms available which allows the user to click on, thus directing them to the relevant social page. The link will open up in a new tab as it gives the user the option to remain on the current page or click onto the social media tab that has just opened.
 - The footer encourages the user to keep connected via social media. It also gives the user confidence of the business / brand given the multiple social plaforms used.
 - The footer is responsive and featured at the bottom on all four pages. The footer is identical on each page to provide a consistent look and ease of navigation.

 ![Footer](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/footer.JPG)
 ### Star Booster Game with Game Score
 - A game of rock, paper, scissors for the user to play vs the computer. This brings further site interaction and a sense of fun and involvement, rather than just a reward chart.
 - There is a game score tally counter above the game board. The parent / carer can decided if the stars earned are to be used toward the final reward choice at the end of the week.
 - The page layout follows the consistent structure delivered across the site with a navigation bar at the top and the footer at the bottom. The colour scheme of the game matches the game button on the home page with the hand icons set in matching nav colours.

 ![Star Booster Game with Game Score](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/star-game.JPG)
 ### Reward Page
 - Upon the user and child completing the weekly tasks, they would navigate to the reward page in order to make their selection. Each reward is listed with a visual picture, name of reward and number of stars the reward costs. The user clicks on the 'claim reward' button to make their choice. Upon so an alert box appears advising them of their choice.
 - The page layout follows the consistent structure delivered across the site with a navigation bar at the top and the footer at the bottom.

 ![Reward Page](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/reward-page.JPG)
 ### Feedback Page
 - The feedback page will allow the user to send in feedback to the site owners using the form provided. It is important to gain feedback in order to improve and develop the site further. 
 - The user will be asked to submit their full name, email address and feedback comments.
 - Below the title of the page is a small sub heading and sentence explaining the reason for the form.
 - The page layout follows the consistent structure delivered across the site with a navigation bar at the top and the footer at the bottom.

 ![Feedback Page](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/feedback-page.JPG)
 ### Responsive Site
 - The site is responsive across various screen sizes from desktop, tablet and through to mobile. The user needs to be able to easily read, navigate and interact with the content across various devices.
 - Specific screen break points are: iphone 5 up to ipad (320px - 767px), ipad up to ipad Pro (768px - 1023px), ipad Pro to desktop (1024px +).
 - The use of Flexbox CSS helped create a responsive site.
 ### Accessibility
 - All images have an alt attribute taking into account users who are visually impaired. The site has contrasting background colours to text enabling an easy read. Background button colours have been set to match the relevant pages defined colour. Semantic HTML has been used to support machines to understand the layout of the site. All links have hover over effect.
 
## Features Left to Implement
 - Stars achieved from the reward chart tasks are to be represented on the games page. If the user succeeds in acheiving more stars from playing the game then the reward chart stars and the game stars are to be totalled together.
 - The totalled stars to be represented on the 'My Reward' page. From this total, once a reward is claimed, the cost of the reward is to be deducted from the total stars. This will bring together the links between the chart page, game page and reward page.
 - On the reward chart, to include a delete button removing a single task.

## Testing
 - I tested the sites interactive content to make sure the functionality worked as intended. In summary:
   - the reward input allowed the typed task to be added to the table with either an enter press or click on 'add' button. 
   - the stars in the chart are clickable to remove the opacity. 
   - the stars achieved counter totals the number of clicked stars.
   - the content of the table remains even when the browser is refreshed or the user comes back to the site.
   - the end of the week reset button removes the chart tables content.
   - playing the game delivers the expected result and are correct.
   - the game score counter tallys correctly and the stars earned counter calculates correctly.
   - the game instructions alert box appears when clicked on.
   - the 'claim reward' buttons bring up an expected alert when clicked on.
   - the feedback form submits correctly with the 'required' propoerty used where needed.
   - all the links work i.e. nav links take the user to the correct page, header logo clicks back through to the home page, footer social media icons open up the site in a new tab.
   - the link hovers work as intended and show the correct styling when cursor over.
   - the pages are responsive and look as intended based on the screen size, with mobile, tablet and desktop the main breakpoints.
   - I asked three family members to test out the site too by sending them the url link and provide honest feedback where possible.
 ### Google Inspect
  - I coded the site using mobile first design. Constantly using Google Inspect in the devtools to check my layout, make amendments, re-check and therefore delivering an end result that fits the brief and user goals. 
 ### Validator Testing
  #### HTML - 
   - All HTML validation was passed through the official W3C validator.
   - index.html returned with two errors, I had duplicated id="star" more than once for the repeat of the star icons in the table. Corrected to number the star ids element. On line 158, I did not include a space between href and class tags, corrected.
   ![Home Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/index-validator.JPG)
   - game.html had one error on line 108 whereby I did not include a space between href and class tags, corrected.
   ![Game Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/game-validator.JPG)
   - reward.html returned no errors.
   ![Reward Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/reward-validator.JPG)
   - feedback.html had two errors on line 60 and 63 whereby I did not include a space between placeholder and required tags, both corrected.
   ![Feedback Page Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/feedback-validator.JPG)
  #### CSS - 
   - No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.
   ![CSS Validator Results](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/css-validator.JPG)
   - Two warnings were displayed, one due to using external style sheet for Google Fonts, one for an unknown vendor extension which I have created to help with the background colour maintenance of the site.
   ![CSS Validator Warnings](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/css-warning-validator.JPG)
  #### JavaScript - 
   - JS Hint Checker was used to highlight any functional errors, none returned. The only warning was regarding semicolons being missing on selected lines. Upon research, this is optional. Nevertheless I felt best practice to use semicolons so corrected both script.js and gsame.js files.
 ### Performance Testing
  - Tested the site on Google Developer Tools Lighthouse for desktop and mobile with good results on both. Performance, accessibility and SEO scored top marks. Best practices at 87 due to browser 404 errors, but nothing of concern which impacts the site.
  ![Lighthouse Results Desktop](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/accessibility-desktop.JPG)
  ![Lighthouse Results Mobile](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/accessibility-mobile.JPG)
  - Tested on [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) which helped me with accessibility, making sure my layout and design worked well with screen readers.
 ### User Stories Testing
  - First time user once on the site is able to understand the reasoning  of the site by the site heading but also the following content of the first page with clear section titles. The page reads from top to bottom with the task section and reward chart being the main content. Page links towards the bottom aid the journey of the user onto the next pages.
  - Returning user is able to interact with the site as intended with the reward table tasks saved to local storage. The game page restarting when returning and the footer icon links enabling the user to search for further content offsite.
  - Frequent user is able to reset the saved tasks and start afresh by clicking on the end of week reset button. The site is clearly structured and encompasses all the required elements to treat the site as the main reward system for the parent / carer. 
  ### Further Testing
  - Site tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari across the responsive page break points with CSS Flexbox working as intended on each page.
  - The site tested on the above browsers but also using the browsers on different operating systems, Microsoft and Apple. This was to check for all links, site elements, screen layout and functionality working as intended. 
  - The site was also tested on mobile, both Samsung Note 10 and iphone 10. Again using Google Chrome on both devices, Safari on Apple and Samsung Internet Browser.
  - All links on the site tested and directed to the correct page.
