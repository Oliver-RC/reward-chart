# My Reward Chart

My Reward Chart is an interactive 'reward star chart' website. Primarily to be used by the parent / carer on a weekly basis to track the number of stars their child has earned for good behaviour. In return for earning stars, the child can choose a reward at the end of the week based on the number of stars achieved. Also, within the website is an interactive 'rock, paper, scissors' game for the child to interact with.

The sites simple look and feel, ease of navigation and interactive content will enable both the parent / carer and child to use together and/or independently. A core aim is to bring a sense of inclusion for the child; to lead what tasks they want to and what reward they want to pick, alongside an fun, interactive game.

## User Experience (UX)

 ### User Stories

  #### First Time Visitor Goals
   1. As a first time visitor I want to understand what the site is about and who the site is intended for. Starting with the title and core content of the page, these elements should give a clear idea.
   2. As a first time visitor the home / index page should be the starting point of the site and include the main interaction for the user.
   3. As a first time visitor the flow of each page should read top to bottom with the interactive content following suit. The home / index page should then allow the user to flow onto the next relevant page.
   4. As a first time visitor I want the content to be in a consistant and simple structure. Navigation bar at the top, main body of the page and footer at the bottom.
   5. As a first time visitor the interactive content should be intuitive and not require content heavy text to explain how to use.
  #### Returning Visitor Goals
   1. As a returning visitor I want to be able to update the interactive reward table with either a new task or star achieved.
   2. As a returning visitor I want to see the site and its content in the same state as it was previously left in order to track reward progress throughout the week.
   3. As a returning visitor I want to be able to interact with the built in 'rock, paper, scissors' game.
   4. As a returning visitor I want to be able to locate the social media links in order to gain further insight and information but delivered through the different platforms: Youtube, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.
  #### Frequent User Goals
   1. As a frequent user once a full week has been completed, I want to be able to reset the page in order to start a new week.
   2. As a frequent user I want the site to be my main 'reward' system for my child. I want the child to eventually become independant in using the site and be the lead in uploading tasks.
   3. As a frequent user I want to be able to provide user feedback to the owner of the site.

## Design

 ### Structure
  - The site will be made up of an initial home page, a game page, a reward page and a feedback form page.
  - Every page will be in a consistant layout aiding simple usability. 
    1. Navigation bar at the top with page title to the left and page links to the right.
    2. Core content of the page.
    3. Social media footer at the bottom.
    4. Consistant colour scheme throughout each page specifically on the header / nav bar, page link buttons and footer.
 ### Colour Scheme
 - Colour scheme of the site designed using: https://coolors.co/
 - The header, nav bar and footer make up the leading colours of the site, that being Mantis, a subtle, light off green, with green being a positive colour related to children and learning.
 - The font colour both in the headings and the body of the site is black as it is clear and consistant. 
 - Each section of the site has a distinct background colour with a supported border, this is consistant on each page. The same goes for each clickable button alongside hover effects when able to click and generate an action.
 ![Site Colour Scheme](https://github.com/Oliver-RC/reward-chart/blob/main/readme-content/my-reward-chart-colour-scheme.png)
 ### Typography
 - The [Bree Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bree+Serif?query=bree+serif) font is used for the headings throughout the site with Serif as the fallback. A relevant style for charts which is both professional and eye to read.
 - The [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?query=open+sans) font is used for the content of the site with Sans-Serif as the fallback. Open Sans works well against the headings giving the font clear lines to read, adult and child friendly.
 ### Imagery
 - Images were only used on the reward page to provide a visual representation of the rewards available. They give the child a clear understanding of the type of reward. They should also be inspirational enough for the child to be motivated to achieve stars for good behaviour.
 - Icons feature heavily across the site with the 'star' icon being the hero in both the title and reward chart table. The 'star' features in the tally count and reward page giving the user visual reminders as to what the stars are for. Within the 'rock, paper, scissors' game, hand icons were used providing a consistant look and feel.
